arpsec_pcap

ARP Security - Pcap (version)

ARPSEC was originated by Patrick McDaniel and Kevin Butler

Futher developed and maintained by Dave Tian

ARPSEC_PACP was originated by Dave Tian based on the work of ARPSEC and TARP

Both arpsec and arpsec_pcap are based on the logic layer and TPM hardware. However, arpsec is using Relay and Netlink socket dealing with the Linux kernel; arpsec_pcap is using a kernel module and libpcap (as well as libnet and libnetlink) to talk with the kernel.
